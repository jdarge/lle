├── build
│   ├── bin

├── CMakeLists.txt

```

## Commands

```console
$ ./run [build/make]
$ ./run rebuild
$ ./run clean
$ ./run
```

Make sure to set the <ins>run</ins> file to be executable.

```console
$ chmod +x run
```

### ./run make/build :

Both do the same thing.
<br>They run CMakeList.txt and then the Makefile generated by CMake.

```console 
$ ./run make
$ ./run build
```

### ./run rebuild :

Deletes previously generated files and then runs CMake and Make

```console
$ ./run rebuild
```

### ./run clean :

Removes the <ins>build/</ins> directory.

```console 
$ ./run clean
```

### ./run :

If there is binary executable inside of <ins>build/bin</ins> it will run it.
<br>If there isn't, it will run the build commands for you...

```console
$ ./run
```
